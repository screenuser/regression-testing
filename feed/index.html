		<description><![CDATA[Regression testing is a perfect example of where automation is an ABSOLUTE must, and UI testing is a great example of a field where writing tests manually isn&#039;t necessarily the best option. It&#039;s really not just that programming tests is difficult or tedious (I&#039;d argue that manual testing is more tedious). WebDriver was created in the era of &#039;lean GUI&#039; where most web UIs were static pages with interaction limited to forms and buttons. For UIs of this type, you didn&#039;t really need to thoroughly test if everything is okay with the layout because all the conversion-critical element of a user journey was concentrated around forms, buttons, and navigation. So basically it was okay to have a script opening a page, checking if the form is there, and if providing the right input values to the form and clicking on submit would give you the right action. Today, you can&#039;t really call this a UI tests. Today things are mostly different on the UI side because we have a lot more logic on the front end. This either requires more manual testing, or a smarter automation solution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh where do I begin:)
&lt;br&gt;
— Screenster doesn&#039;t just capture screenshots, it analyzes the DOM of the page and stores a DOM snapshot for each baseline.
&lt;br&gt;
— It actually recognizes content. It can recognize text, and &lt;strong&gt;it can even tell dates apart from other text&lt;/strong&gt;. So if you&#039;re dealing with auto-updating timestamps, Screenster will handle them us such.
&lt;br&gt;
— It captures self-healing locators for each element. If a change to your code results in renaming or relocating an element, Screenster will still be able to locate if with a 99% probability.
&lt;br&gt;
— Screenster doesn&#039;t use simplistic pixel-by-pixel comparison. And I&#039;m not talking about change/% tolerance either. Screenster can look and visually verify UI elements. This is more accurate than comparing screenshots of the complete page.]]></description>
